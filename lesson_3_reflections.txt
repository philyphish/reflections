When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you were working on a different computer or on someone elses project, you would want to use the
remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you were in the middle of a big project, you wouldn't want git to automatically start pulling commits.
