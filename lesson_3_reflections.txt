When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you were working on a different computer or on someone elses project, you would want to use the
remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you were in the middle of a big project, you wouldn't want git to automatically start pulling commits. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are like clones of repositories but they are copies of other users repositories. You can make changes to the forked copies of the repositories but not
the oringinal. Clones are repositories to your local directory. Branches are part of the master repository but are separated from the
master head. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Incase you're offline and need to work. Once you're reconnected, you can push your commits to the cloud.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could colaborate using email, but this wouldn't be very efficiant. I would be a lot easier. Simply send an email. However, I would be very time
consumming and tracking changes would be nearly impossible, especialy with large projects. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Use a second branch when you're adding new features to a project. The benifits of this is that you can keep your original, master intact and funtioning
as you work.
